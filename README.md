### Odin Javascript Project: Library
#### Submitted on 2024-07-15

<p>
    Mybrary is a project for the Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript curriculum, specifically the second project in the 
    JavaScript section. The goal of this project is to practice working with classes, constructors, and prototypes in
    a simple library app. The app allows users to add books to their library, mark them as read, and delete them.
</p>
<p>
    There is no persistent database, but a few books are added to the library by default and you are able to add or remove 
    books as you like as long as you don't refresh the page. The app is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
</p>
